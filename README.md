# TicTacToe
This is one of the Single-Page-Apps I had created at my earlier coding time during studying the online course from freeCodeCamp. 

I did it on CodePen.io with JQuery. You can select to play it first or second. 

For the fun, I intentionally designed the AI a little bit 'random', so you can still win the game sometimes.

## How to play
- Choose play X (go first) or O (go second)
- Try connecting your three markers in one straight line of either horizonal, vertical or diagonal to win the game
- Block your rival for the same thing!

## Nerd's thinking
#### Gains:
- It was fun to write the program
- As one of my early achievements in coding, it gave me great confidence
- My friends liked it

#### Pains:
- Too many functions and variables
- Styling with CSS was annoying
- If the AI was completely random, game would be too easy and boring. However, if the AI followed the unique correct strategy, fun would be ruined. So how to catch the balance between them was a headache to me
